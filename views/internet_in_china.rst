About China's Internet censorship, there are different opinions.
Regarding the maintenance of the neutrality of the Internet,
we do not publish any political opinions.
We only quote a paragraph of `racaljk`_
(he also shows to some extent our point of view).

The information in this paragraph is only for China.
Only mainland residents have a reading significance,
so no longer provide English materials, please understand.
