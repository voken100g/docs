Alpha Testing VS. Beta Testing
------------------------------

Seems that many people do know alpha and beta (even never heard about?), here is a brief intro: What is the difference?


Alpha Testing
_____________

Alpha Testing is a type of acceptance testing;
performed to identify all possible issues and bugs before releasing the final product to the end-users.
Alpha testing is carried out by the testers,
which are internal employees of the organization.
The main goal is to identify the tasks that a typical user might perform and test them.

To put it as simple as possible,
this kind of testing is called alpha only because it is done early on,
near the end of the software development, and before beta testing.
The main focus of alpha testing is to simulate real users using a black box and white box techniques.


Beta Testing
____________

Beta Testing is performed by "real users" of the software application in a "real environment."
It can be considered a form of external User Acceptance Testing.
It is the final test before shipping a product to the customers.
Direct feedback from customers is a significant advantage of Beta Testing.
This testing helps to test products in the customer's environment.

Beta version of the software is released to a limited number of end-users of the product to obtain product quality feedback.
Beta testing reduces product failure risks and provides increased quality of the work through customer validation.


vnCHAIN Susitna
---------------

(We hadn't named the alpha stage without vnCHAIN.)

Sustina River is the 15th largest river int the United States (unfragmented),
313 miles long in South-central Alaska.
The river stretches from the Susitna Glacier to Cook Inlet's Knik Arm.

We named the beta stage Susitna after vnCHAIN had successfully networked and started to work (milestone).
And it is not yet perfect.
More extensive testing and feedback will help voken products mature quickly.
Susitna will be the last test stage before the official release of the product.
The first name of the official product will be Copper.


.. note::

   For testing or updating purposes,
   the development team may restart vnCHAIN Susitna at any time,
   and your Susitna VOKEN balance (just beta, not real fund) may be rolled back.



Voken HD Wallet Toolkit
-----------------------

A toolkit to generate your key-pairs/addresses, validate address.

:ref:`web_wallet_toolkit`

To get some Susitna VOKEN for joining the test, just send your address to the Telegram group.


AccountNetwork
--------------

AccountNetwork temporarily not participated by users before prod.

T.B.C.


ProxyNetwork and ProxyContainers
--------------------------------

The ProxyContainers would provide decentralized proxy services.
The computer which running a ProxyCointainer could earn VOKEN by providing proxy service.

Will allow users to participate when the Proxy-ClientBase is relatively complete.


Proxy-ClientBase for PC
-----------------------

You can start a Proxy-ClientBase on your desktop or laptop PC now.
It would provide a local Socks5 proxy for you, which is based on vnTUNNEL (encrypted).

Here is a :ref:`first_time_to_client_base`
