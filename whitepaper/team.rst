Given the special nature of vnVPN applications in the Vision Network,
we had to choose to temporarily keep team members anonymous
and retain the right to disclose the true identity of team members.

Currently, Vision Network has gathered a group of like-minded
and capable technology geeks and business design geniuses.
Project sponsor Michael is a serial entrepreneur who specializes in cross-border,
and is also an excellent architect.
Our team includes members of the Microsoft P2P project,
the master engineer of the underlying communications protocol
for a well-known international router,
and the digital technology elite from Google, IBM and Oracle.
The backbone is already full-time on the Vision Network team
and some members work part-time.
