Voken and distribution plan
===========================

Use it, invest it, not hype it
------------------------------

This is also our **blockchain technology application** value philosophy.

We are building an increasingly mature system,
in which :ref:`voken` will be the only measure of value and means of payment
in such a sustainable and healthy environment.
It is clear that the basic design of 1 Voken = 100GB
after ecological maturity will ensure that
the price of Voken is not destined to deviate too much
from the anchoring of its actual use value.
We expect users with real demands to buy Vokens through exchanges
or other channels and use it for appropriate network services.
Of course, the value logic of Voken is so clear that proper investment is also a good choice.


Total 35 billion, absolute majority amount will be handed over to the users
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The team and the early investors held only 25.47% of the total,
and most of them are freezed.

74.53% of the Vokens will ultimately be held by users.
