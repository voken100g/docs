Voken 2.0 community alliance program
====================================

We know that every single person, even a company or a team,
all have their strengths and limitations.
It also involves the V5 team that made contributions to the early stages of the project.
A thriving ecosystem must have the participation of many drives;
we are looking forward to and welcome more people to join the Vision Network.

If you have the resources and capabilities
and are willing to participate in the community,
please send us an email.
