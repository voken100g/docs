Service Value & Usage Value ANCHORING
-------------------------------------

- **1 Voken = 100GB** client traffic, solid value base.
- 100GB is worth about **$8.00 - 8.50 USD**
  in mature IDCs and cloud service platforms,
  such as `Amazon AWS`_ and `Google GCP`_.
- You can spend ``1 Voken`` to exchange ``100GB traffic``
  to use the unblocked accessible Internet,
  or earn Voken by selling/sharing your idle bandwidth.

Gift for whitelist
------------------

Anyone who participate in the :ref:`voken2_sale`
by using a whitelisted ETH wallet address
would enjoy a gift of **BUY ONE AND GET ONE MORE FREE**.

- :ref:`how_to_join_the_whitelist`
- The gift will be reserved in 6 months.
- :ref:`how_to_shorten_the_reserved_time`



For example
-----------

If you send **20 ETH** to the :ref:`voken2_sale_contract`
at the **7500th stage**,
and the **Audit ETH price** goes to **$200 USD** for example:

- This **20 ETH** will be treated as `$200 x20 ETH =` **$4,000 USD**.
- At the **7500th stage**,
  the exchange price is **$0.07600**,
  that is `$4000 / $0.07600 =` **52,631.578947 Voken2.0**.
- If your address is whitelisted,
  according to **BUY ONE AND GET ONE MORE FREE** privilege,
  you will receive a gift of **52,631.578947 Voken2.0**.

Finally, the amount is `52,631.578947 + 52,631.578947 =` **105,263.157894 Voken2.0**.

How to shorten the reserved time of gift
----------------------------------------

The gift for whitelist will be reserved in 6 months (180 days).

Both **making direct sales (Lv.1)** and **increasing your holding** will take effect:

- | Making direct sale (Lv.1) for every m Voken2.0, reduced by 1 day.
  | **Reduced to at least 4 months (120 days).**
- | Increasing holding for every m Voken2.0, reduced by 1 months (30 days).
  | **Reduced to at least 3 months (90 days).**
