"Although the fresh definition is indeed easier to catch the eyeballs, but "
"that is not what we want. Innovation-driven development is a complex system "
"engineering. In the Vision Network system solutions and ecosystem, we "
"advocate and encourage innovation that can solve practical problems, improve"
" efficiency, reduce costs, and solve problems."

"For example, the DHT technology, represented by S/Kademlia DHT, has "
"completed many generations of updates, the intranet penetration and node "

"the distributed file sharing system represented by BitTorrent, the directed "
"acyclic graph DAG, the Merkle tree, the asymmetric encryption and decryption"
" technology represented by RSA / ElGamal / ECC, the virtual private network "
"and proxy technology represented by OpenVPN and Shadowsocks(r), the secure "
"transmission technology represented by SSL/TLS and IPsec, blockchain data "
"structure and so on, these are very precious experience and resources."

"Unrestrained valuation expansion is not the original intention of Vision "
