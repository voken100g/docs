"Although the fresh definition is indeed easier to catch the eyeballs, but "
"that is not what we want. Innovation-driven development is a complex system "
"engineering. In the Vision Network system solutions and ecosystem, we "
"advocate and encourage innovation that can solve practical problems, improve"
" efficiency, reduce costs, and solve problems."
