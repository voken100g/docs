"As we all know, since the public sale, we have encountered some unforeseen "
"troubles. The most challenging thing is that the centralized exchanges "
"forced the listing of the VOKEN. It not only interrupted our sales plan but "
"also brought some holders in the loss of interest. Our original plan was to "
"announce the exchange whitelist plan after the 10th season and start the "
"trading market in an orderly manner. Why should we start the trading plan at"
" a particular stage, to maximize the protection of the holder's profits! "
"However, due to the open-source feature of VOKEN, many exchanges forcibly "
"meddled the ecology, without approved. They also disrupted the market price,"
" which has brought many troubles to the public-sale and community "
"foundation."
msgstr ""
"众所周知，自公开发售以来，我们遇到了一些未能预见的麻烦。最具挑战性的是中心化交易所迫使 VOKEN "
"上市交易。它不仅打断了我们的销售计划，还让一些持有人受到损失。我们原来的计划是在第 10 "
"赛季后公布交易所白名单计划，并有条不紊地开始交易。我们为什么要在特定阶段启动交易计划，是为了最大限度地保护持有人的利润！然而，由于 VOKEN "
"的开源特征，许多交易所在未经批准的情况下强行干预了生态。他们还扰乱了市场价格，这给公共销售和社区建设会带来了许多麻烦。"

"A project without value never gets noticed, and many exchanges have seen the"
" value of the Vision Network project, which is an excellent performance for "
"the industry. In the prior time, some exchanges have also used their traffic"
" to drive, which is worth affirming. However, according to our observations,"
" some unknown exchanges produced a large amount of fake VOKEN and data. That"
" is not consistent with the actual circumstance of the market, because some "
"people want to create panic to gain personal benefit. It also confirms our "
"speculation, but at that time, we did not have rather data, and it is not "
"advisable to make arbitrary conclusions by guessing. That is why we made a "
"global announcement, rejected some of the community members' requests for us"
" to manipulate the market to drive prices. Therefore, we lost some "
"supporters who thought we were not following the advice. However, the real "
"situation is that we don't want all the participants to run hard, but only "
"the exchanges get the benefits. No matter who plays in the market price "
"manipulation, the profiteering party can only be the exchange, not the "
"holders of VOKEN."

"一个没有价值的项目永远不会引起注意，许多交易所已经看到了远景网络项目的价值，这是在行业内的一个优秀表现。在过去的时间里，一些交易所也利用他们的流量来帮助项目推进，这是值得肯定的。然而，根据我们的观察，一些不知名的交易所也制制了大量假的"
" VOKEN "
"和数据。这与市场的实际情况不符，因为有些人想制造恐慌以获得个人利益。这也证实了我们的猜测，但当时我们没有足够的数据，并且不想通过猜测做出武断的结论。这就是我们做出全球公告、拒绝了一些社区成员要求我们操纵市场来推动价格的原因。因此，我们失去了一些认为我们没有遵循建议的支持者。然而，真实情况是我们不希望参与者的努力，最后只有交易所获益。无论谁参与市场价格操纵，获利方只能是交易所，而不是"
